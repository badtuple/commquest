Commquest
=========

Community oriented Idle(ish) RPG.

### Overview

All users in a chat room are considered active Players. Players choose their character's name, class, etc. but don't directly control their actions.

The purpose of Commquest is to:
* Be a fun thing for a channel/group/community to do!
* Allow people to publicly express thanks to others in the channel.
* Let moderators add custom achievements to encourage behaviors in the channel.


Will be able to use any chat program as a frontend. Right now Slack, Discord, Twitch, and IRC are planned.  There will also be a raw API that will allow you to build your own private integration if you prefer.

### Gameplay

* Players get xp for being in the channel and for their characters completing quests.
* Players can give "kudos" to other players that act as buffs and give xp.
* Players can register quotes that become spells or catchphrase for other characters.
* The story and quests play out in the background, and is not directly driven by the Players.

### Moderation features / Configuration options

* Customizable achievement system
* Customizable placeholders that will be used in the stories and quests
* Ability to ban players
