Commquest
=========

Community oriented Idle(ish) RPG.

Players log onto chat and are considered active players.
They can adjust their character's name, class, etc. but can't directly control their actions.

Players can give "kudos" to other players that act as buffs.
Players can register quotes that become spells or catchphrase for other characters.
The story/quest plays out in the background, and is not driven by the characters in any way.

Can use any chat program (Slack, Discord, Twitch, IRC, etc...) as the frontend.
